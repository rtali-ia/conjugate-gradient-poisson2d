# conjugate-gradient-poisson2d
This repo fully implements the full conjugate gradient using MPI, OpenMP and Serial in C++ for the 2D Poisson Equation


#Instructions

1. Navigate into the respective folder for MPI, Open MP and Serial Code
2. Look for <>.job file
3. Run the .job file using sbatch <>.job
4. Please note : We tested this code using openmpi module instead of intel module
5. This code is meant to be run on a HPC using the slurm script
